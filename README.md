### Welcome to my personal website! 

Here is a bit about me. I am currently a Math PhD student at Drexel University in my final year. I love learning and problem solving, and I also enjoy collaberating as well as teaching the things I have learned. My current research involves proving things about waves travelling through lattices made of "random" material. If you want to know more about my research, please start with my research statement located in this repositrory. I find the use of simulations especially helpful in learning, and I am hoping to use this page in the future to upload any numerical work related to my research. I hoping to continue my a career in research after. 

## Research regarding Waves in Lattices with Random Material Components 

Here is link to a paper I wrote with my advisor, J. Douglas Write, I published proving the existense of travelling waves in a 1D lattice with random material components: https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/dcdss.2021100

I followed this up with a 2D lattice (the analysis was harder in the 2D case). See this preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15760
